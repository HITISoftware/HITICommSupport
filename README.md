# HITICommSupport
Arduino support library for HITIComm library.
<br>

Optimized for working with HITISoftware products (https://hitisoftware.com, Tahiti Robotics SARL):
* HITIPanel: GUI for Arduino projects, serial plotting and logging, GUI for Eeprom, control with keyboard
* HITIBrain: Arduino control from Emotiv EEG headsets
<br>

# Support library
HITIComm is an open-source library but it requires a large amount of Arduino program memory (15kB).
To speed up compilation, it is supplied pre-compiled to users.
However, the compiled file called "libHITIComm.a" is processor architecture-dependant (atmega328p, cortex-m0plus,...) and not board dependant.
And HITIComm uses many board-dependant macros that can only be resolved at compile time.
The job of HITICommSupport is to resolve those macros before they are used by HITIComm.
